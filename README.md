## Enclosure

Enclosure is 3D printed as three press fitting parts; the body holds the microcontroller and boost converter with internal slots, and M2 countersunk screws hold the switch in place.
The LED panel sits in a recess and the wires feed into the body through a hole from the front.
Laser-cut clear acrylic strips were glued into the front slots.
